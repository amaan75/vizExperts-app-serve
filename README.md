TO run the project please go to the root of both folders 
1. [app](https://github.com/amaan75/vizExperts-app-serve/tree/master/app)
2. [server](https://github.com/amaan75/vizExperts-app-serve/tree/master/server)

and when you are there type\
`npm run dev`\
please run the server(port:3000) first and then the app(port:9000).\
